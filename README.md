# Financial and Risk Forecasting Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to examine the quality of an insurance dataset, uncover hidden patterns, and forecast trends related to financial and risk forecasting using machine learning techniques. Additionally, the project identifies the ideal customer profile (ICP) using clustering methods.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Customer ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Annual Income`: Annual income of the customer.
- `Price ($)`: Price of the car insured.
- `Amount_paid_for_insurance`: Amount paid by the customer for insurance.
- `Date`: Date of the transaction.
- `Claim amount`: Amount claimed by the customer.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset and perform initial cleaning steps.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand distributions, correlations, and key statistics.
3. **Financial and Risk Forecasting**: Build predictive models to forecast claim amounts and assess customer risk.
4. **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**: Identify key customer segments using clustering techniques and profile the ideal customer.

## Setup and Usage
To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-risk-forecasting.git
    cd financial-risk-forecasting
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    - Open `financial_risk_forecasting.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
    - Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Key Findings
- **Data Quality**: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and ensure consistency in data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis was conducted to understand the distributions and correlations among the features.
- **Financial and Risk Forecasting**: Predictive models were built to forecast claim amounts and assess customer risk.
- **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**: Customer segments were identified, and the ideal customer profile was defined using clustering techniques.

## Results and Recommendations
### Key Insights
- **EDA Insights**: The distribution analysis revealed significant variability in claim amounts. Higher annual incomes are associated with lower claim amounts.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Strong correlations were observed between the amount paid for insurance and claim amounts, indicating that higher premiums are associated with higher claim amounts.
- **Risk Forecasting**: The Random Forest model identified annual income and car price as significant predictors of claim amounts.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Three distinct customer segments were identified. The ideal customer profile (Cluster 0) includes customers with higher annual incomes and lower claim amounts.

### Recommendations
- **Targeted Marketing**: Focus marketing efforts on the ideal customer profile (Cluster 0) to maximize profitability.
- **Risk Management**: Implement stricter risk assessment protocols for higher-risk segments (Clusters 1 and 2).
- **Premium Adjustments**: Consider adjusting insurance premiums based on customer segments to better reflect risk levels.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into financial and risk forecasting for the insurance dataset and identified the ideal customer profile. The findings and recommendations can help improve marketing strategies, risk management, and premium adjustments.
